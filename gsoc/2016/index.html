<p><strong>This year the Scala team applied again for the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of
  Code</a>
  program to work with enthusiastic students on challenging Scala
  projects</strong></p>

<p>This page provides a list of project ideas. The suggestions are only a
starting point for students. We expect students to explore the ideas
in much more detail, preferably with their own suggestions and
detailed plans on how they want to proceed. Don’t feel constrained by
the provided list! We welcome any of your own challenging ideas, but
make sure that the proposed project satisfies the <a href="#requirements-and-guidelines">main
requirements</a> mentioned below.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-involved">How to get involved</h3>

<p>The best place to propose and discuss your proposals is our
<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/scala-language">“scala-language”</a>
mailing list. This way you will get quickly responses from the whole
Scala community.</p>

<h3 id="previous-summer-of-code">Previous Summer of Code</h3>

<h2 id="project-ideas">Project Ideas</h2>

<p>Here are some project ideas. The list is non-binding and any reasonable
project related to Scala that is proposed by a student will be thoroughly
reviewed.</p>

<h3 id="revamp-slick-code-generator">Revamp Slick Code-generator</h3>

<p>There is a long list of smaller and medium sized open tickets for the Slick code generator.
Time to tackle them and give it another overhaul. This is going to be a very useful and somewhat easier project.</p>

<h3 id="slick-bug-and-feature-hunt">Slick bug and feature hunt</h3>

<p>There are lots of open tickets in the Slick issue tracker. Some which have long time fallen behind. This project would
be about tackling as many of them as time permits. It will be a good chance to learn about the Slick code base
and have an impact in this successful project. Some issues may be simple, but many issues may be challenging to fix and will require someone smart, dedicated and persistent enough to learn the details of how Slick works.</p>

<h3 id="super-charged-for-comprehensions">Super-charged for-comprehensions</h3>

<p>Super-charged for-comprehensions are an effort to implement an alternative direct-style dyntax for monadic comprehensions in Scala.
The goals are reduction in syntax, enabling more control flow expressions, inline Monad value extraction and transformer operations on the Monad context (as in Comprehensive Comprehensions). At the time of writing the project is in heavy flux. Depending on its status there will likely be interesting idea how to take the project further. One likely topic would be exploring type changing comprehensive comprehension transformers, such as groupBy or aggregations. The implementation heavily relies on macros and will require learning how to work with Scala’s compiler ASTs and make changes to the AST transformation stages.</p>

<h3 id="a-next-generation-scala-build-tool">A next generation Scala build tool</h3>

<p>This project is about extending and contributing to the implementation of a vision that only exist in partial, unreleased prototypes right now. The idea is to build a tool for a intuitive, easy to use, composable, statically checked builds that is used like an ordinary Scala library with no surprises. Several pieces of the puzzle exist as prototypes, but need improvement and many other pieces are entirely missing. In particular this GSOC project could be about building an interface to interoperate with SBT builds and SBT plugins, using them as components in new style builds. Other features yet to be built include publishing artifacts, signing them using GPG, packaging and many more. The exact tasks will depend on the state of the project at the time GSOC applications happen. It will be a chance to work on tooling and contribute to something that has a chance to maybe some day change something fundamental in the Scala eco system.</p>

<h3 id="pushing-scala-coroutines-to-the-next-level">Pushing Scala Coroutines to the Next Level</h3>

<p><a href="http://storm-enroute.com/coroutines/">Scala Coroutines</a> is a library-level extension for the Scala programming language that introduces first-class coroutines.</p>

<p>Coroutines are a language abstraction that generalizes subroutines (i.e. procedures, methods or functions). Unlike a subroutine, which is invoked once and executes until it completed, a coroutine can pause execution and yield control back to the caller, or another coroutine. The caller can then resume the coroutine when appropriate. Coroutines have a number of use cases, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>data structure iterators</li>
  <li>event-driven code without the inversion of control</li>
  <li>cooperative multitasking</li>
  <li>concurrency frameworks such as actors, async-await and dataflow networks</li>
  <li>expressing asynchrony, and better composition of asynchronous systems</li>
  <li>capturing continuations</li>
  <li>expressing backtracking</li>
  <li>AI agents such as behaviour trees</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of this project is to extend documentation and tests of Scala Coroutines, potentially improve parts of the Coroutines implementation, and then implement a standard suite of extensions for Scala Coroutines. These extensions will be a separate module in the project, and will offer support for the use cases listed above: concisely creating collection iterators using coroutines, async-await support, continuation support, backtracking testing support, and/or a fiber library module. All the extensions will have to be documented.</p>

<h3 id="better-scripts-in-scala">Better Scripts in Scala</h3>

<p>There are several hacky, ad-hoc ways to write scripts in Scala already, e.g. SBT’s script-runner, and the <a href="https://github.com/lihaoyi/Ammonite">Ammonite REPL</a>’s script loader. Your task in this project would be to improve the experience writing scripts using Ammonite to be on-par with the experience writing scripts in any other language, as well as on-par with the experience writing Scala code in a large project. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improving startup time: SBT is terribly slow, and even Ammonite scripts take 1-2 seconds to boot up, This is speed-up-able.</li>
  <li>Improved error reporting: Ammonite’s scripts currently report line-numbers and file-names based on the mangled compilation-unit. We should report based on the location within the source file a user wrote.</li>
  <li>Ammonite requires two steps to install (Java, Ammonite). There is no reason it should take more than 1 command to bootstrap the script-runner on a new system</li>
  <li>IDE support: Ammonite’s syntax isn’t supported by major IDEs, meaning you lose in-editor errors, autocomplete, and other things when writing your script. This can be added</li>
  <li>Windows support: the Ammonite-REPL does not currently work on windows due to terminal-interaction issues. We should make it work and put it in CI.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="flexible-fast-parser-combinators">Flexible Fast Parser Combinators</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/lihaoyi/fastparse">The FastParse library</a> is a modern replacement for Scala’s old parser combinators library. It provides similar API, drops a lot of redundant operators, and runs 50-100x faster. However, right now it only parses Strings.</p>

<p>This project would be to extend FastParse to parse other things. Cases to cover include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Binary data: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Array[Byte]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ByteBuffer</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ByteString</code>, letting us parse things like binary files, network protocols, or other formats</li>
  <li>Streaming data: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Iterator[String]</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Iterator[Char]</code>, letting us parse files while not materializing the entire contents in memory</li>
  <li>Pre-tokenized data: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Seq[T]</code> for an arbitrary <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code>, letting you re-use a pre-written lexer before your parser</li>
</ul>

<p>Using virtual classes, we should be able to extend FastParse to do this while still re-using most of our code. Your task would be to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make FastParse able to handle 2 or 3 of the above cases</li>
  <li>Demonstrate use-cases by using FastParse to write parsers for well-known formats: .zip, .class, streaming JSON or XML-SAX parsing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fault-handling-for-function-passing">Fault Handling for Function-Passing</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/205822">Function-Passing programming model</a>
is a new programming model designed with distributed programming in mind. The
model is formalized and comes with a prototype implementation, but while
fault-handling is worked out and formalized, it is not yet implemented.</p>

<p>This project would include implementing F-P’s fault-handling specification, and
empirically evaluating the model across different sorts of applications.</p>

<h3 id="dottydoc-a-documentation-generator-for-dotty">DottyDoc: A Documentation Generator for Dotty</h3>

<p>Dotty is a brand new Scala compiler, designed to help us try out concepts of
future Scala language versions. The compiler is a new design intended to reflect
the lessons we learned from work with the Scala compiler.</p>

<p>Along with a new compiler and new foundation for Scala, we’d also like to
reimagine generated documentation for Scala. This project aims to build a new
documentation generation tool (à la Scaladoc) for the Dotty compiler.</p>

current minimalistic REPL with advanced functionality to improve
end-user’s experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/densh/scala-offheap">scala-offheap</a> is a new project that
exposes user-controllable memory management to Scala programmers. At the moment
it has fairly limited array-based collection API. Your goal in this project
would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expand existing functionality of combinator methods on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">offheap.Array[T]</code></li>
  <li>Port implementation of maps to scala-offheap (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">offheap.Map[K, V]</code>)</li>
  <li>Port implementation of sets to scala-offheap (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">offheap.Set[T]</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="java-source-code-or-bytecode-to-scalajs-ir-compiler">Java source code (or bytecode) to Scala.js IR compiler</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.scala-js.org/">Scala.js</a> is the Scala to JavaScript compiler.
While it can compile any .scala source files to JavaScript, it is unable to
compiler Java source files. This can be annoying to Scala.js developers, as
they cannot reuse existing Java libraries like Scala/JVM developers do.</p>

<p>This project consists in writing a compiler from Java source code to the
Intermediate Representation (IR) of Scala.js. The later phases of the existing
pipeline would then be reused to compile that IR to JavaScript.</p>

<p>The Java-to-IR compiler should probably reuse an existing an existing Java
parser and typechecker. From typechecked Java ASTs, it should be relatively
straightforward to compile them down to the Scala.js IR (except some corner
cases, but not <em>everything</em> needs to be supported).</p>

<p><em>Alternative</em>: Writing a compiler from the JVM <em>bytecode</em> to the Scala.js IR.
This is a priori much more difficult, but it might be easier for a student
already familiar with the JVM bytecode.</p>

<p>The compiler will be written in Scala for the JVM. Working knowledge of Scala
is expected.</p>

<p>The project requires a relatively good knowledge of compiler construction in
general. <strong>Your application should include your background in compiler
construction.</strong> Ideally, it should point to a compiler project you have written
(e.g., a student project of a compiler course).</p>

<h3 id="scala-compiler-plugin-for-parser-combinators">Scala Compiler Plugin for Parser Combinators</h3>

<p>Parsing can be found everywhere in computing today: from log analysis to
computer languages. Functional programming offers concise approach to
parser generators development: a parsing grammar for generator is composed
via higher-order functions – <a href="https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf">parser combinators</a>.</p>

<p>As a program, parser generator should be programmed easily and work fast.
Popular parser generators in Scala (<a href="https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators">Scala Combinator Parsers</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled2">parboiled2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lihaoyi/fastparse">FastParse</a>,
<a href="https://lakhin.com/projects/papa-carlo/">PapaCarlo</a>, etc.) can be much faster
or have complications in development.</p>

<p>Scala Combinator Parsers library is most concise. It is implemented as plain
library in Scala. And because of that has few facilities for optimizations.</p>

<p>parboiled2 drops off most of algebraic sanity, and leaves a programmer with
imperative-style parsing and Value Stack. That causes type soundness bugs,
clumsy code that is hard to debug, and bad error reporting. FastParse fixes
most critical issues of parboiled2. But both lacks can’t perform cross-rules
analysis and deep optimisations.</p>

<p>The proposed solution requires users to use SBT build system with external plugin.
Scala compiler plugin should rewrite Scala AST of a parser: compile high-level
concise monadic Scala Combinator Parsers to highly-effective runtime code.</p>

<p>The plugin would be written in Scala. Existing projects written in Scala
are expected. Ideally you should have understanding of compilers in
general and Scala compiler inner parts.</p>

<h2 id="requirements-and-guidelines">Requirements and Guidelines</h2>

<h3 id="general-student-application-requirements">General Student Application Requirements</h3>

<p>This is the sixth time the Scala project has applied to the Summer of
Code, and from last years experience, increased popularity of the
language and stories of other mentor organizations we expect a high
number of applications. First, be aware of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure that you understand, fulfill and agree to the general
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/">Google Summer of Code rules</a></li>
  <li>The work done during GSoC requires some discipline from the
students as they have to plan their day-to-day activities by
themselves. Nevertheless we expect regular contact with the
mentors by the usual forms of communication (mail, chat, phone) to
make sure that the development is going according to the plan and
students don’t get stuck for weeks at a time (3 months may seem
long, but in reality it is very easy to run out of time).</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">official SoC timetable</a>
mentions May 23 as the official start of coding, but if you
have time you are encouraged to research your proposals even
before that (and definitely learn the basics of Scala, if you
haven’t done that already).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="student-application-guidelines">Student Application Guidelines</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Student proposals should be very specific. We want to see evidence
that you can succeed in the project. Applications with one-liners
and general descriptions definitely won’t make the cut.</li>
  <li>Because of the nature of our projects students must have at some
knowledge of the Scala language. Applicants with Scala programming
experience will be preferred. Alternatively, experience with
functional programming could suffice, but in your application we
want to see evidence that you can quickly be productive in Scala.</li>
  <li>You can think of Google Summer of Code as a kind of independent
internship. Therefore, we expect you to work full-time during the
duration. Applicants with other time commitments are unlikely to
be selected. From our previous experience we know that students’
finishing their studies (either Bachelor, Master of PhD) are
likely to be overwhelmed by their final work, so please don’t be
too optimistic and carefully plan your time for the project.</li>
  <li>If you are unsure whether your proposal is suitable, feel free to
discuss it on our
<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/scala-language">“scala-language”</a>
mailing list. We have many community members on our mailing list
who will quickly answer any of your questions regarding the
project. Mentors are also constantly monitoring the mailing
list. Don’t be afraid of asking questions, we enjoy solving
puzzles like that!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="general-proposal-requirements">General Proposal Requirements</h3>

<p>The proposal will be submitted via the standard web-interface at
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/</a>,
therefore plain text is the best way to go. We expect your application
to be in the range of 700-1500 words. Anything less than that will
probably not contain enough information for us to determine whether
you are the right person for the job.</p>

<p>Your proposal should contain at least the following information, but
feel free to include anything that you think is relevant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Please include your name (weird as it may be, people do forget
about it)</li>
  <li>Title of your proposal</li>
  <li>Abstract of your proposal</li>
  <li>Detailed description of your idea including explanation on why is
it innovative (maybe you already have some prototype?), what
contribution do you expect to make to the Scala community and why
do you think your project is needed, a rough plan of your
development and possible architecture sketches.</li>
  <li>Description of previous work, existing solutions (links to
prototypes, bibliography are more than welcome!)</li>
  <li>Write us about yourself and convince us that you are the right
person for the job (linking to your resume/CV is good but not
sufficient)
    <ul>
      <li>Mention the details of your academic studies, any previous
work, internships</li>
      <li>Any relevant skills that will help you to achieve the goal
(programming languages, frameworks)?</li>
      <li>Any previous open-source projects (or even previous GSoC) you
have contributed to?</li>
      <li>Do you plan to have any other commitments during SoC that may
affect you work? Any vacations/holidays planned? Please be
specific as much as you can.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you apply to more than one GSoC project, especially if you also apply
for a project in another organization, specify which project has your
preference. In case two organizations choose to accept your applications,
we can then give you the project that is most important to you.
Preferring the project of another organization will <em>not</em> influence our
decision whether to accept your application.</li>
